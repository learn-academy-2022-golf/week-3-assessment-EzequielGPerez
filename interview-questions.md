# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is used to introduce JavaScript into HTML. One syntax difference is JSX uses className vs HTML using class. 

Researched answer: JSX is a piece of React and lets you use UI's. You can think of JSX as sysntatic sugar for React. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. Usually HTML and JavaScript are used separately but React makes it so you can have both working together. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a command we use in the terminal and basically it downloads packages for you in your computer. It is like the highway that can deliver to and from you.

Researched answer: Yarn was created by Facebook in collaboration with Google, Exponent, and Tilde. It is a software packaging system that works with JavaScript. It is a package manager. Yarn does parallel installation which leads to faster speeds and performance. Running yarn starts the development of a package. 

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function is a function with no name, a blank function. You don't asign the function a variable. 

Researched answer: An anonymous function does not have a name. It can be used as an arguement in another function. 

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State is the local memory of the app. I can store memory for example on how many characters you've typed, what you,ve pressed, and so on. Value works with state. Value is for example what the user is typing like "Car". Props in React are a way for React components to communicate. In a way it works like a function.

Researched answer: State is used to keep track of datatypes and values. They are only stored locally so if the web page is refreshed the state will refresh too. State is managed in each component. Values are what the user inputs into for example a text bar. Values can be a datatype like numbers or letters. Props is short for properties. They pass information between components. They are unidirectional. Props can be changed and are a "read only" value. 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer:DOM is what the user sees. It is the user interface. It also makes it so if you for example like a image on Instagram it won't refresh the whole page, just that element.

Researched answer:DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is how the browser reads your XML or HTML document. It is structured like tree diagram and that is how it gets read. It lets you modify the XML or HTML document. It is your code visualized. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: What I do know is that a div is like a container and it can contain code. It can also have more divs inside of it to organize more code into. I am not sure what a span is but I can come back with a researched answer. 

Researched answer: Span and div are similar in which they can contain code but div is a block-level element, which means it will occupy the whole horizontal space, whereas span is an inline element which means it just takes the spac it needs by whatever is occupied in it. It will not take a whole horizontal space. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Also known as OOP is a way of programming with classes and objects that are related by the methods they are associated with. It is fundamental to many programming languages. It is modeling a whole system as a whole collection of objects. 

2. Ruby: It is a dynamic language. Considered high-level. Mainly used for making web apps. Used for both front and back end developing. 

3. Implicit return: It is a way to get a function returned without using the keyword. In arrow functions you can skip the need to use the keyoword.

4. Ruby blocks: They are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods. They can have multiple arguements. They consist of blocks of code. 

5. Ruby hashes: It is a collection of unique keys and their values. Similar to an array. They can have methods.
